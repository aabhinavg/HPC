**What Is HPC**
  <pr>
- HPC abbrevation is High Performance Computing. From the abbrevation it is clear that HPC is a concept which is used in high performance computing.       The term computing means peforming high and complex calculations.
- Therfore HPC can also be defined as a capacity to process data and perform complex calculations at a high speed.
- Best solution of HPC is supercomputer. HPC do the [parallel processing](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/parallel-processing) of the   data.</pr>

**Why HPC Is Important**
<pr>
- Single core is too small to solve the modern problems and even if the single core is able to solve the problem but it will not be able to solve in a 
  tolerable amount of time. We can use HPC technology to get output of the complex computing in minimal amount of time.
- To keep a step ahead of the competition, organizations need lightning-fast, highly reliable IT infrastructure to process, store, and analyze massive     amounts of data. This can also be done using HPC.
- HPC is also now being used in industry to improve products, reduce production costs and decrease the time it takes to develop new products.
- Use of HPC is even more than you can imagine above are the two example which just give a keen idea of how we can use HPC. </pr>

**Who Use HPC**
<pr>
- Company who want to improve their products, reduce production costs and decrease the time it takes to develop new products want to use HCP.
- HPC is more recently is being used by researchers in social media, semantics, geology, archeology, materials, urban planning, graphics, genomics,       brain imaging, economics, game design and even music. This list will go on adding as people get knowledge to the possibilities of using HPC, bringing   their own unique understanding of how it can be used in their fields.
